    <h1>Just ask, don't ask for ask</h1>
    <p>
      Every now and then, in online chat rooms I hang around in, someone pops in and says something along the lines of,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">negroboy101:</span>
      <p class="message">
        Any Windows experts around?
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This is bad form, for several reasons. What the person is actually asking here is,
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">negroboy101:</span>
      <p class="message">
        Is there anyone who could help me with my Windows problem? I would like someone to commit to solving my problem, whatever it may be, even if it's not directly related to Windows or if someone who knows nothing about Windows could answer my question.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      There are plenty of reasons why people who DO have the knowledge would not admit to it. By asking, you're asking for more than what you think you're asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      You're asking people to take responsibility. You're questioning people's confidence in their abilities. You're also unnecessarily excluding other people. I often answer questions related to languages or libraries I have never used because the answers are, in a programmer kind of way, common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, it can be seen as..
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <span class="name">negroboy101:</span>
      <p class="message">
        I have a question about Windows, but I'm too lazy to actually formalize it in words unless there's someone on the channel who might be able to answer it.
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      ..which is just lazy. If you're not willing to do the work to solve your problem, why should we?
    </p>
    <p>
      The solution is not to ask to ask, but just to ask. Someone who is idling on the channel and only occasionally glances at what's going on is unlikely to answer your "asking to ask" question, but your actual problem description may pique their interest and get them to answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, to summarize, don't ask "Any Windows experts around?", but rather ask "How do I solve [your problem] with Windows and [other relevant information]?"
